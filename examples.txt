Remove resources from PE
`emit <file> | pestrip -r | dump <outputname>`

Explained:
Pass the file using `emit` to `pestrip` using the `-r` option for resources, `dump` the output to file.

----------------------------------------

Extract NSIS 
`emit <file> | xtnsis [ | dump archive/{path} ]`
Explained:
Pass the file using `emit` into the NSIS parser `xtnsis`. There are likely multiple files, so pass the multiple units received back into a bracketed object [ ]. In this case, we will dump the files to disk using `dump archive/{path}`: this will create a directory named "archive" and will write the individual files based on their name.


-----------------------------------------
List Singlefile dotNet binaries
ef <file> | dnsfx -l runtimeconfig
Explained:
ef is an alias for emit file. Pass the file into the dot net extractor `dnsfx` and list the contents with the -l option, specifying "runtimeconfig" limits the listing of files to files with the name "runtimeconfig". In the case of SingleFile dotnet, this will help identify the interesting executables.
