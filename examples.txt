Remove resources from PE
`emit <file> | pestrip -r | dump <outputname>`

Explained:
Pass the file using `emit` to `pestrip` using the `-r` option for resources, `dump` the output to file.

Extract NSIS 
`emit <file> | xtnsis [ | dump archive/{path} ]`
Explained:
Pass the file using `emit` into the NSIS parser `xtnsis`. There are likely multiple files, so pass the multiple units received back into a bracketed object [ ]. In this case, we will dump the files to disk using `dump archive/{path}`: this will create a directory named "archive" and will write the individual files based on their name.
